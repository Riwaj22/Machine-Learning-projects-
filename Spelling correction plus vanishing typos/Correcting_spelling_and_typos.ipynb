The demand for items is a combined effect of form utility and time utility, i.e., a product must both be intrinsically appealing to a consumer and the time must be right for purchase. In particular for durable goods, time utility is a function of inter-purchase duration within product category because consumers are unlikely to purchase two items in the same category in close temporal succession. Moreover, purchase data, in contrast to ratings data, is implicit with non-purchases not necessarily indicating dislike. Together, these issues give rise to the positive-unlabeled demand-aware recommendation problem that we pose via joint low-rank tensor completion and product category inter-purchase duration vector estimation. We further relax this problem and propose a highly scalable alternating minimization approach with which we can solve problems with millions of users and millions of items in a single thread.

Currently, the most popular implementation, t-SNE, is restricted to a particular Student t-distribution as its embedding distribution. Moreover, it uses a gradient descent algorithm that may require users to tune parameters such as the learning step size, momentum, etc., in finding its optimum. In this paper, we propose the Heavy-tailed Symmetric Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (HSSNE) method, which is a generalization of the t-SNE to accommodate various heavy-tailed embedding similarity functions. With this generalization, we are presented with two difficulties.  The first is how to select the best embedding similarity among all heavy-tailed functions and the second is how to optimize the objective function once the heave-tailed function has been selected. Our contributions then are: (1) we point out that various heavy-tailed embedding similarities can be characterized by their negative score functions. Based on this finding, we present a parameterized subset of similarity functions for choosing the best tail-heaviness for HSSNE; (2) we present a fixed-point optimization algorithm that can be applied to all heavy-tailed functions and does not require the user to set any parameters; and (3) we present two empirical studies, one for unsupervised visualization showing that our optimization algorithm runs as fast and as good as the best known t-SNE implementation and the other for semi-supervised visualization showing quantitative superiority using the homogeneity measure as well as qualitative advantage in cluster separation over t-SNE.\",\n          \"Adaptive schemes, where tasks are assigned based on the data collected thus far, are widely used in practical crowdsourcing systems to efficiently allocate the budget.

Under this generalized Dawid-Skene model, we characterize the fundamental trade-off between budget and accuracy, and introduce a novel adaptive scheme that matches this fundamental limit. We further quantify the gain of adaptivity, by comparing the trade-off with the one for non-adaptive schemes, and confirm that the gain is significant and can be made arbitrarily large depending on the distribution of the difficulty level of the tasks at hand.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"paper_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7237,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Statistical Performance of Convex Tensor\\nDecomposition\\nRyota Tomioka?\\nTaiji Suzuki?\\nDepartment of Mathematical Informatics,\\nThe University of Tokyo\\nTokyo 113-8656, Japan\\ntomioka@mist.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp\\ns-taiji@stat.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp\\n\\nKohei Hayashi?\\nGraduate School of Information Science,\\nNara Institute of Science and Technology\\nNara 630-0192, Japan\\nkohei-h@is.naist.jp\\n\\n?\\n\\n?\\n\\nHisashi Kashima?,?\\nBasic Research Programs PRESTO,\\nSynthesis of Knowledge for Information Oriented Society, JST\\nTokyo 102-8666, Japan\\nkashima@mist.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp\\n?\\n\\nAbstract\\nWe analyze the statistical performance of a recently proposed convex tensor decomposition algorithm. Conventionally tensor decomposition has been formulated as non-convex optimization problems, which hindered the analysis of their\\nperformance. We show under some conditions that the mean squared error of\\nthe convex method scales linearly with the quantity we call the normalized rank\\nof the true tensor. The current analysis naturally extends the analysis of convex\\nlow-rank matrix estimation to tensors. Furthermore, we show through numerical\\nexperiments that our theory can precisely predict the scaling behaviour in practice.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\nTensors (multi-way arrays) generalize matrices and naturally represent data having more than two\\nmodalities. For example, multi-variate time-series, for instance, electroencephalography (EEG),\\nrecorded from multiple subjects under various conditions naturally form a tensor. Moreover, in\\ncollaborative ?ltering, users? preferences on products, conventionally represented as a matrix, can\\nbe represented as a tensor when the preferences change over time or context.\\nFor the analysis of tensor data, various models and methods for the low-rank decomposition of\\ntensors have been proposed (see Kolda & Bader [12] for a recent survey). These techniques have\\nrecently become increasingly popular in data-mining [1, 14] and computer vision [25, 26]. Besides\\nthey have proven useful in chemometrics [4], psychometrics [24], and signal processing [20, 7, 8].\\nDespite empirical success, the statistical performance of tensor decomposition algorithms has not\\nbeen fully elucidated. The dif?culty lies in the non-convexity of the conventional tensor decomposition algorithms (e.g., alternating least squares [6]). In addition, studies have revealed many\\ndiscrepancies (see [12]) between matrix rank and tensor rank, which make extension of studies on\\nthe performance of low-rank matrix models (e.g., [9]) challenging.\\nRecently, several authors [21, 10, 13, 23] have focused on the notion of tensor mode-k rank (instead\\nof tensor rank), which is related to the Tucker decomposition [24]. They discovered that regularized\\nestimation based on the Schatten 1-norm, which is a popular technique for recovering low-rank\\nmatrices via convex optimization, can also be applied to tensor decomposition. In particular, the\\n1\\n\\n\\fConvex\\nTucker (exact)\\nOptimization tolerance\\n\\n0\\n\\n10\\n\\n?3\\n\\n10\\n\\n0\\n\\n0.2\\n0.4\\n0.6\\n0.8\\nFraction of observed elements\\n\\n1\\n\\nFigure 1: Result of estimation of rank-(7, 8, 9) tensor of dimensions\\n50???? 50 ? 20 from partial\\n???\\n? ?

Gray dashed\\nline shows the optimization tolerance 10?3 . The question is how we can predict the point where the\\ngeneralization begins (roughly m = 0.35 in this plot).\\n\\nstudy in [23] showed that there is a clear transition at certain number of samples where the error\\ndrops dramatically from no generalization to perfect generalization (see Figure 1).\\nIn this paper, motivated by the above recent work, we mathematically analyze the performance of\\nconvex tensor decomposition. The new convex formulation for tensor decomposition allows us to\\ngeneralize recent results on Schatten 1-norm-regularized estimation of matrices (see [17, 18, 5, 19]).\\nUnder a general setting we show how the estimation error scales with the mode-k ranks of the true\\ntensor. Furthermore, we analyze the speci?c settings of (i) noisy tensor decomposition and (ii)\\nrandom Gaussian design. In the ?rst setting, we assume that all the elements of a low-rank tensor\\nis observed with noise and the goal is to recover the underlying low-rank structure. This is the most\\ncommon setting a tensor decomposition algorithm is used. In the second setting, we assume that\\nthe unknown tensor is a coef?cient of a tensor-input scalar-output regression problem and the input\\ntensors (design) are randomly given from independent Gaussian distributions. Surprisingly, it turns\\nout that the random Gaussian setting can precisely predict the phase-transition-like behaviour in\\nFigure 1. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ?rst paper that rigorously studies the performance\\nof a tensor decomposition algorithm.\\n\\n2\\n\\nNotation\\n\\nIn this section, we introduce the notations we use in this paper. Moreover, we introduce a H?olderlike inequality (3) and the notion of mode-k decomposability (5), which play central roles in our\\nanalysis.\\nQK\\nLet X ? Rn1 ????nK be a K-way tensor. We denote the number of elements in X by N = k=1 nk .\\n?\\nThe inner product between two tensors ?W, X ? is de?ned as ?W, X ? = vec(W)\\np ), where\\n??? ??? vec(X\\nvec is a vectorization. In addition, we de?ne the Frobenius norm of a tensor ???X ???F = ?X , X ?.\\nQ\\nThe mode-k unfolding X (k) is the nk ? n\\n? \\\\k (?\\nn\\\\k := k? ?=k nk? ) matrix obtained by concatenating\\nthe mode-k ?bers (the vectors obtained by ?xing every index of X but the kth index) of X as column\\nvectors. The mode-k rank of a tensor X , denoted by rankk (X ), is the rank of the mode-k unfolding\\nX (k) (as a matrix). Note that when K = 2 and X is actually a matrix, and X (2) = X (1) ? . We say\\na tensor X is rank (r1 , . . . , rK ) when rk = rankk (X ) for k = 1, . . . , K. Note that the mode-k rank\\ncan be computed in a polynomial time, because it boils down to computing a matrix rank, whereas\\ncomputing tensor rank is NP complete [11]. See [12] for more details.\\nSince for each k, the convex envelope of the mode-k rank is given as the Schatten 1-norm [18]\\n(known as the trace norm [22] or the nuclear norm [3]), it is natural to consider the following\\n2\\n\\n\\f??? ???\\noverlapped Schatten 1-norm ???W ???S of a tensor W ?

The dual norm of the Schatten 1-norm is the\\nSchatten ?-norm (known as the spectral norm) as follows:\\n?X?S? = max ?j (X).\\nj=1,...,r\\n\\nSince the two norms ? ? ?S1 and ? ? ?S? are dual to each other, we have the following inequality:\\n|?W , X?| ? ?W ?S1 ?X?S? ,\\n(2)\\nwhere ?W , X? is the inner product of W and X.\\nThe same inequality holds for the overlapped Schatten 1-norm (1) and its dual norm. The dual norm\\nof the overlapped Schatten 1-norm can be characterized by the following lemma.\\n??? ???\\nLemma 1. The dual norm of the overlapped Schatten 1-norm denoted as ???????S ? is de?ned as the\\n1\\nin?mum of the maximum mode-k spectral norm over the tensors whose average equals the given\\ntensor X as follows:\\n??? ???\\n(k)\\n???X ??? ? =\\nmax ?Y (k) ?S? ,\\ninf\\nS1\\n1\\n(1) +Y (2) +???+Y (K) =X\\nk=1,...,K\\nY\\n(\\n)\\nK\\n(k)\\n\\nwhere Y (k) is the mode-k unfolding of Y (k) .

Rn1 ?????nK be the low-rank tensor that we wish to recover. We assume that W ?\\nis rank (r1 , . . . , rK ). Thus, for each k we have\\nW ?(k) = U k S k V k\\n(k = 1, . . . , K),\\nwhere U k ? Rnk ?rk and V k ? Rn? \\\\k ?rk are orthogonal, and S k ? Rrk ?rk is diagonal. Let\\n? ? Rn1 ?????nK be an arbitrary tensor. We de?ne the mode-k orthogonal complement ???k of an\\nunfolding ?(k) ?

[15].\\n3\\n\\n\\f3\\n\\nTheory\\n\\nIn this section, we ?rst present a deterministic result that holds under a certain choice of regularization constant ?M and an assumption called the restricted strong convexity. Then, we focus on\\nspecial cases to justify the choice of regularization constant and the restricted strong convexity assumption. We analyze the setting of (i) noisy tensor decomposition and (ii) random Gaussian design\\nin Section 3.2 and Section 3.3, respectively.\\n3.1\\n\\nMain result\\n\\nOur goal is to estimate an unknown rank (r1 , . . . , rK ) tensor W ? ? Rn1 ????nK from observations\\nyi = ?Xi , W ? ? + ?i (i = 1, . . . , M ).\\n(6)\\nHere the noise ?i follows the independent zero-mean Gaussian distribution with variance ? 2 .\\nWe employ the regularized empirical risk minimization problem proposed in [21, 10, 13, 23] for the\\nestimation of W as follows:\\n??? ???\\n1\\nminimize\\n?y ?

The Schatten 1-norm term penalizes every mode of W to be jointly low-rank (see Equation (1));\\n?M > 0 is the regularization constant. Accordingly, the solution of the minimization problem (7) is\\ntypically a low-rank tensor when ?M is suf?ciently large. In addition, we denote the adjoint operator\\nPM\\nof X as X? : RM ?

For\\nthe matrix case, we randomly generated low-rank matrices of dimensions 50 ? 20, 100 ? 40, and\\n250 ? 200. For the tensor case, we randomly generated low-rank tensors of dimensions 50 ? 50 ? 20\\nand 100 ? 100 ? 50. We generated the matrices or tensors as in the previous subsection for various\\nranks.

No observation noise is added. We used the ADMM for ?as a\\nmatrix? and ?constraint? approaches described in [23] to solve the minimization problem (7) for\\nmatrix completion and tensor completion, respectively. Since there is no observation noise, we\\nchose the regularization constant ? ? 0. A single experiment for a speci?c size and rank can be\\nvisualized as in Figure 1.\\n?In\\n?? Figure ?3,\\n??? we plot the minimum fraction of observations m = M/N that achieved error\\n? ? W ??? smaller than 0.01 against the normalized rank r? = ?n?1 ?1/2 ?r?1/2 (of the true ten???W\\nF\\nsor) de?ned in Equation (13). The matrix case is plotted in Figure 3(a) and the tensor case is plotted\\nin Figure 3(b). Each series (blue crosses or red circles) corresponds to different matrix/tensor size\\nand each data-point corresponds to a different core size (rank). We can see that the fraction of observations m = M/N scales linearly against the normalized rank r?, which agrees with the condition\\nM/N ? c1 ?n?1 ?1/2 ?r?1/2 = c1 r? in Theorem 3 (see Equation (14)). The agreement is especially\\ngood for tensor completion (Figure 3(b)), where the two series almost overlap. Interestingly, we\\ncan see that when compared at the same normalized rank, tensor completion is easier than matrix\\ncompletion. For example, when nk = 50 and rk = 10 for each k = 1, . . . , K, the normalized rank\\nis 0.2. From Figure 3, we can see that we only need to see 30% of the entries in the tensor case to\\nachieve error smaller than 0.01, whereas we need about 60% of the entries in the matrix case.\\n\\n5\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nWe have analyzed the statistical performance of a tensor decomposition algorithm based on the\\noverlapped Schatten 1-norm regularization (7). Numerical experiments show that our theory can\\npredict the empirical scaling behaviour well. The fraction of observation m = M/N at the threshold\\npredicted by our theory is proportional to the quantity we call the normalized rank, which re?nes\\nconjecture (sum of the mode-k ranks) in [23].\\nThere are numerous directions that the current study can be extended. In this paper, we have focused\\non the convergence of the estimation error; it would be meaningful to also analyze the condition for\\nthe consistency of the estimated rank as in [2]. Second, although we have succeeded in predicting\\nthe empirical scaling behaviour, the setting of random Gaussian design does not match the tensor\\ncompletion setting in Section 4.2. In order to analyze the latter setting, the notion of incoherence in\\n[5] or spikiness in [16] might be useful. This might also explain why tensor completion is easier than\\nmatrix completion at the same normalized rank. Moreover, when the target tensor is only low-rank\\nin a certain mode, Schatten 1-norm regularization fails badly (as predicted by the high normalized\\nrank). It would be desirable to analyze the ?Mixture? approach that aims at this case [23]. In\\na broader context, we believe that the current paper could serve as a basis for re-examining the\\nconcept of tensor rank and low-rank approximation of tensors based on convex optimization.\\nAcknowledgments.

Ghiselli-Crippa and Paul W. Munro\\nDepartment of Information Science and Telecommunications\\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\\nPittsburgh, PA 15260\\ntbgst@sis.pitt.edu, munro@sis.pitt.edu\\n\\nAbstract\\nSpatial information comes in two forms: direct spatial information (for\\nexample, retinal position) and indirect temporal contiguity information,\\nsince objects encountered sequentially are in general spatially close. The\\nacquisition of spatial information by a neural network is investigated\\nhere. Given a spatial layout of several objects, networks are trained on a\\nprediction task. Networks using temporal sequences with no direct spatial information are found to develop internal representations that show\\ndistances correlated with distances in the external layout. The influence\\nof spatial information is analyzed by providing direct spatial information\\nto the system during training that is either consistent with the layout or\\ninconsistent with it. This approach allows examination of the relative\\ncontributions of spatial and temporal contiguity.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\nSpatial information is acquired by a process of exploration that is fundamentally temporal, whether it be on a small scale, such as scanning a picture, or on a larger one, such as\\nphysically navigating through a building, a neighborhood, or a city. Continuous scanning\\nof an environment causes locations that are spatially close to have a tendency to occur in\\ntemporal proximity to one another. Thus, a temporal associative mechanism (such as a\\nHebb rule) can be used in conjunction with continuous exploration to capture the spatial\\nstructure of the environment [1]. However, the actual process of building a cognitive map\\nneed not rely solely on temporal associations, since some spatial information is encoded in\\nthe sensory array (position on the retina and proprioceptive feedback). Laboratory studies\\nshow different types of interaction between the relative contributions of temporal and spatial contiguities to the formation of an internal representation of space. While Clayton and\\nHabibi's [2] series of recognition priming experiments indicates that priming is controlled\\nonly by temporal associations, in the work of McNamara et al. [3] priming in recognition is observed only when space and time are both contiguous. In addition, Curiel and\\nRadvansky's [4] work shows that the effects of spatial and temporal contiguity depend on\\nwhether location or identity information is emphasized during learning. Moreover, other\\nexperiments ([3]) also show how the effects clearly depend on the task and can be quite\\ndifferent if an explicitly spatial task is used (e.g., additive effects in location judgments).\\n\\n\\fT.

An\\nencoder-like network architecture is used (see Figure 1), with a set of N input units and a\\nset of N output units representing N nodes on a 2-dimensional graph. A set of H units is\\nused for the hidden layer. To include space in the learning process, additional spatial units\\nare included in the network architecture. These units provide a representation of the spatial\\ninformation directly available during the learning/scanning process. In the simulations described in this paper, two units are used and are chosen to represent the (x, y) coordinates of\\nthe nodes in the graph . The spatial units can be included as part of the input representation\\nor as part of the output representation (see Figure 1, center and right panels): both choices\\nare used in the experiments, to investigate whether the spatial information could better benefit training as an input or as an output [5]. In the second case, the relative contribution of\\nthe spatial information can be directly manipulated by introducing weighting factors in the\\ncost function being minimized. A two-term cost function is used, with a cross-entropy term\\nfor the N label units and a squared error term for the 2 coordinate units,\\n\\nri indicates the actual output of unit i and ti its desired output. The relative influence of\\n\\nthe spatial information is controlled by the coefficients A and B.\\n\\n3\\n\\nLearning tasks\\n\\nThe left panel of Figure 2 shows an example of the type of layout used; the effective\\nlayout used in the study consists of N = 28 nodes. For each node, a set of neighboring\\nnodes is defined, chosen on the basis of how an observer might scan the layout to learn the\\nnode labels and their (spatial) relationships; in Figure 2, the neighborhood relationships are\\nrepresented by lines connecting neighboring nodes. From any node in the layout, the only\\nallowed transitions are those to a neighbor, thus defining the set of node pairs used to train\\nthe network (66 pairs out of C(28, 2) = 378 possible pairs). In addition, the probability\\nof occurrence of a particular transition is computed as a function of the distance to the\\ncorresponding neighbor. It is then possible to generate a sequence of visits to the network\\nnodes, aimed at replicating the scanning process of a human observer studying the layout.\\n\\n\\f19\\n\\nSpatiotemporal Contiguity Effects on Spatial Information Acquisition\\n\\neraser\\n\\nknife\\n\\ncup\\n\\ncoin\\n\\neraser\\n\\nbutton\\n\\nFigure 2: Example of a layout (left) and its permuted version (right). Links represent\\nallowed transitions. A larger layout of 28 units was used in the simulations.\\n\\nThe basic learning task is similar to the grammar learning task of Servan-Schreiber et al.\\n[6] and to the neighborhood mapping task described in [1] and is used to associate each of\\nthe N nodes on the graph and its (x, y) coordinates with the probability distribution of the\\ntransitions to its neighboring nodes. The mapping can be learned directly, by associating\\neach node with the probability distribution of the transitions to all its neighbors: in this\\ncase, batch learning is used as the method of choice for learning the mapping. On the\\nother hand, the mapping can be learned indirectly, by associating each node with itself\\nand one of its neighbors, with online learning being the method of choice in this case;\\nthe neighbor chosen at each iteration is defined by the sequence of visits generated on\\nthe basis of the transition probabilities. Batch learning was chosen because it generally\\nconverges more smoothly and more quickly than online learning and gives qualitatively\\nsimilar results. While the task and network architecture described in [1] allowed only\\nfor temporal association learning, in this study both temporal and spatial associations are\\nlearned simultaneously, thanks to the presence of the spatial units. However, the temporalonly (T-only) case, which has no spatial units, is included in the simulations performed\\nfor this study, to provide a benchmark for the evaluation of the results obtained with the\\nspatio-temporal (S- T) networks.\\nThe task described above allows the network to learn neighborhood relationships for which\\nspatial and temporal associations provide consistent information, that is, nodes experienced\\ncontiguously in time (as defined by the sequence) are also contiguous in space (being spatial neighbors). To tease apart the relative contributions of space and time, the task is kept\\nthe same, but the data employed for training the network is modified: the same layout is\\nused to generate the temporal sequence, but the x , y coordinates of the nodes are randomly\\npermuted (see right panel of Figure 2). If the permuted layout is then scanned following the\\nsame sequence of node visits used in the original version, the net effect is that the temporal\\nassociations remain the same, but the spatial associations change so that temporally neighboring nodes can now be spatially close or distant: the spatial associations are no longer\\nconsistent with the temporal associations. As Figure 4 illustrates, the training pairs (filled\\ncircles) all correspond to short distances in the original layout, but can have a distance\\nanywhere in the allowable range in the permuted layout. Since the temporal and spatial\\ndistances were consistent in the original layout, the original spatial distance can be used\\nas an indicator of temporal distance and Figure 4 can be interpreted as a plot of temporal\\ndistance vs. spatial distance for the permuted layout.\\nThe simulations described in the following include three experimental conditions: temporal\\nonly (no direct spatial information available); space and time consistent (the spatial coordinates and the temporal sequence are from the same layout); space and time inconsistent\\n(the spatial coordinates and the temporal sequence are from different layouts).\\n\\n\\fT. B. Ghise/li-Crippa and P. W. Munro\\n\\n20\\n\\nHidden unit representations are compared using Euclidean distance (cosine and inner product measures give consistent results); the internal representation distances are also used to\\ncompute their correlation with Euclidean distances between nodes in the layout (original\\nand permuted). The correlations increase with the number of hidden units for values of\\nH between 5 and 10 and then gradually taper off for values greater than 10. The results\\npresented in the remainder of the paper all pertain to networks trained with H = 20 and\\nwith hidden units using a tanh transfer function; all the results pertaining to S-T networks\\nrefer to networks with 2 spatial output units and cost function coefficients A = 0.625 and\\nB = 6.25.\\n\\n4 Results\\nFigure 3 provides a combined view of the results from all three experiments. The left panel\\nillustrates the evolution of the correlation between internal representation distances and\\nlayout (original and permuted) distances. The right panel shows the distributions of the\\ncorrelations at the end of training (1000 epochs). The first general result is that, when spatial information is available and consistent with the temporal information (original layout),\\nthe correlation between hidden unit distances and layout distances is consistently better\\nthan the correlation obtained in the case of temporal associations alone. The second general result is that, when spatial information is available but not consistent with the temporal\\ninformation (permuted layout), the correlation between hidden unit distances and original\\nlayout distances (which represent temporal distances) is similar to that obtained in the case\\nof temporal associations alone, except for the initial transient. When the correlation is computed with respect to the permuted layout distances, its value peaks early during training\\nand then decreases rapidly, to reach an asymptotic value well below the other three cases.\\nThis behavior is illustrated in the box plots in the right panel of Figure 3, which report the\\ndistribution of correlation values at the end of training.\\n\\n4.1\\n\\nTemporal-only vs. spatio-temporal\\n\\nAs a first step in this study, the effects of adding spatial information to the basic temporal\\nassociations used to train the network can be examined. Since the learning task is the same\\nfor both the T-only and the S-T networks except for the absence or presence of spatial\\ninformation during training, the differences observed can be attributed to the additional\\nspatial information available to the S-T networks.

The higher asymptotic correlation\\nbetween internal representation distances and temporal distances, as opposed to spatial\\ndistances (see Figure 3), is apparent also from the examination of the evolutionary plots,\\nwhich show an asymptotic behavior with respect to temporal distances (see Figure 7, top\\npanel) very similar to the T-only case (see Figure 6, bottom panel).\\n\\n5 Discussion\\nThe first general conclusion that can be drawn from the examination of the results described\\nin the previous section is that, when the spatial information is available and consistent with\\nthe temporal information (original layout), the similarity structure of the hidden unit representations is closer to the structure of the original layout than that obtained by using\\ntemporal associations alone. The second general conclusion is that, when the spatial information is available but not consistent with the temporal information (permuted layout),\\nthe similarity structure of the hidden unit representations seems to correspond to temporal\\nmore than spatial proximity. Figures 5 and 7 both indicate that temporal associations take\\nprecedence over spatial associations. This result is in agreement with the results described\\nin [1], showing how temporal associations (plus some high-level constraints) significantly\\ncontribute to the internal representation of global spatial information. However, spatial information certainly is very beneficial to the (temporal) acquisition of a layout, as proven by\\nthe results obtained with the S-T network vs. the T-only network.\\nIn terms of the model presented in this paper, the results illustrated in Figures 5 and 7 can\\nbe compared with the experimental data reported for recognition priming ([2], [3], [4]),\\nwith distance between internal representations corresponding to reaction time.

The situation\\nof identical radially symmetric receptive fields for all neurons, which\\nis usually considered in the literature, turns out to be disadvantageous\\nfrom an information-theoretic point of view. Both a variability of tuning widths and a fragmentation of the neural population into specialized\\nsubpopulations improve the encoding accuracy.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\nThe topic of neuronal tuning properties and their functional significance has focused much\\nattention in the last decades. However, neither empirical findings nor theoretical considerations have yielded a unified picture of optimal neural encoding strategies given a sensory\\nor motor task. More specifically, the question as to whether narrow tuning or broad tuning\\nis advantageous for the representation of a set of stimulus features is still being discussed.\\nEmpirically, both situations are encountered: small receptive fields whose diameter is less\\nthan one degree can, for example, be found in the human retina [7] , and large receptive\\nfields up to 180 0 in diameter occur in the visual system of tongue-projecting salamanders\\n[10]. On the theoretical side, arguments have been put forward for small [8] as well as for\\nlarge [5, 1,9, 3, 13] receptive fields.\\nIn the last years, several approaches have been made to calculate the encoding accuracy\\nof a neural population as a function of receptive field size [5, 1,9,3, 13]. It has turned\\nout that for a firing rate coding, large receptive fields are advantageous provided that D 2:\\n3 stimulus features are encoded [9, 13]. For binary neurons, large receptive fields are\\nadvantageous also for D = 2 [5,3].\\nHowever, so far only radially symmetric tuning curves have been considered. For neural\\npopulations which lack this symmetry, the situation may be very different. Here we study\\nthe encoding accuracy of a popUlation of stochastically spiking neurons. A Fisher information analysis performed on different distributions of tunings widths will indeed reveal a\\nmuch more detailed picture of neural encoding strategies.\\n\\n\\fC. W. Eurich. S. D.

A stimulus is characterized by a position\\nx\\n(Xl, ... , XD) E X, where the value of feature i, Xi (i\\n1, ... , D), is measured\\nrelative to the total range of values in the i-th dimension such that it is dimensionless.\\nInformation about the stimulus is encoded by a popUlation of N stochastically spiking\\nneurons. They are assumed to have independent spike generation mechanisms such that the\\njoint probability distribution for observing n = (n(l), ... ,n(k), ... ,n(N?) spikes within a\\ntime interval T, Ps(n; x), can be written in the form\\n\\n=\\n\\n=\\n\\nN\\n\\nPs(n;x) =\\n\\nII\\n\\nps(k) (n(k);\\n\\nx),\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nk=l\\nwhere Ps(k) (n(k); x) is the single-neuron probability distribution of the number of observed\\nspikes given the stimulus at position x. Note that (1) does not exclude a correlation of the\\nneural firing rates, i.e., the neurons may have common input or even share the same tuning\\nfunction.\\nThe firing rates depend on the stimulus via the local values of the tuning functions, such that\\nx) can be written in the form Ps(k) (n(k); x) = S (n(k), j(k) (x), T), where the\\ntuning function of neuron k, j(k) (x), gives its mean firing rate in response to the stimulus\\nat position x.

For a population oftuning functions with centers e(l), ... , e(N), a\\ndensity 1}(x) is introduced according to 1}(x) := L:~=l 8(x - e(k?).\\nThe encoding accuracy can be quantified by the Fisher information matrix, J, which is\\ndefined as\\n(3)\\n\\nwhere E[ . ..J denotes the expectation value over the probability distribution P(n; x) [2].\\nThe Fisher information yields a lower bound on the expected error of an unbiased estimator\\nthat retrieves the stimulus x from the noisy neural activity (Cramer-Rao inequality) [2]. The\\nminimal estimation error for the i-th feature Xi, ti,min, is given by t;,min = (J - 1 )ii which\\nreduces to t;,min = 1/ Jii(X) if J is diagonal.\\nWe shall now derive a general expression for the popUlation Fisher information.

From (8) it becomes immediately clear that the\\nexpected minimal square encoding error for the i-th stimulus feature, ?~ min = 1/ (Jii(X))u,\\ndepends on i, i. e., the population specializes in certain features. The error obtained in\\ndimension i thereby depends on the tuning widths in all dimensions.\\nWhich encoding strategy is optimal for a population whose task it is to encode a single\\nfeature, say feature i, with high accuracy while not caring about the other dimensions? In\\norder to answer this question, we re-write (8) in terms of receptive field overlap.\\nFor the tuning functions f(k) (x) encountered empirically, large values ofthe single-neuron\\nFisher information (4) are typically restricted to a region around the center of the tuning\\nfunction, c(k). The fraction p({3) of the Fisher information that falls into a region ED\\nJ~(k)2 ~ (3 aroundc(k) is given by\\n\\nf\\np({3)\\n\\n:=\\n\\nd\\n\\nE; d\\nX\\n\\nD\\n\\nD\\n\\n\\\"\\\",D\\nX L....i=l\\n\\nX\\n\\n(k) ( )\\nJ ii X\\n\\n2:~t=l J~~)\\n( )\\nu\\nX\\n\\nj3\\n\\nf\\n\\nd~ ~D+l At/>(e, F, T)\\n\\no\\n\\n(9)\\n\\n00\\n\\nf\\n\\nd~ ~D+l At/>(~2, F, T)\\n\\no\\n\\nwhere the index (k) was dropped because the tuning curves are assumed to have identical shapes. Equation (9) allows the definition of an effective receptive field, RF~~,\\ninside of which neuron k conveys a major fraction Po of Fisher information, RF~~ :=\\n\\n{xl~ ~ {3o} , where (3o is chosen such that p({3o)\\n\\n= Po. The Fisher information a\\n\\nneuron k carries is small unless x E RF~~. This has the consequence that a fixed stimulus\\nx is actually encoded only by a subpopulation of neurons. The point x in stimulus space is\\ncovered by\\n27r D/ 2({30)D D _\\n(10)\\nNcode:= 1] Dr(D/2)\\n(Jj\\n\\n}1\\n\\nreceptive fields. With the help of (10), the average population Fisher information (8) can\\nbe re-written as\\n(11)\\n\\nEquation (11) can be interpreted as follows: We assume that the population of neurons\\nencodes stimulus dimension i accurately, while all other dimensions are of secondary importance. The average population Fisher information for dimension i, (Jii ) u, is determined\\nby the tuning width in dimension i, (ji, and by the size of the active subpopulation, N code '\\nThere is a tradeoff between these quantities. On the one hand, the encoding error can be\\ndecreased by decreasing (ji, which enhances the Fisher information carried by each single\\n\\n\\fNeural Representation ofMulti-Dimensional Stimuli\\n\\n119\\n\\nneuron. Decreasing ai, on the other hand, will also shrink the active subpopulation via\\n(10). This impairs the encoding accuracy, because the stimulus position is evaluated from\\nthe activity of fewer neurons. If (11) is valid due to a sufficient receptive field overlap,\\nNcode can be increased by increasing the tuning widths, aj, in all other dimensions j i- i.\\nThis effect is illustrated in Fig. 2 for D = 2.\\n\\nX2\\nc=:>\\n\\nx2, s\\n\\nX2\\n,II\\\"\\\\..\\\\\\n\\nU\\nx2,s\\n\\nFigure 2: Encoding strategy for a stimulus characterized by parameters Xl,s and X2,s' Feature Xl is to be encoded accurately. Effective receptive field shapes are indicated for both\\npopulations. If neurons are narrowly tuned in X2 (left), the active population (solid) is\\nsmall (here: Ncode = 3). Broadly tuned receptive fields for X2 (right) yield a much larger\\npopulation (here: Ncode = 27) thus increasing the encoding accuracy.\\nIt shall be noted that although a narrow tuning width ai is advantageous, the limit ai ---t 0\\nyields a bad representation. For narrowly tuned cells, gaps appear between the receptive\\nfields: The condition 17(X) == const. breaks down, and (6) is no longer valid. A more\\ndetailed calculation shows that the encoding error diverges as ai --* 0 [4]. The fact that\\nthe encoding error decreases for both narrow tuning and broad tuning - due to (11) - proves\\nthe existence of an optimal tuning width, An example is given in Fig. 3a.\\n3\\n\\nrTI~--~------~----~------~\\n\\n1\\\\\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nIi\\n\\n1\\\\\\n\\nIi\\n\\n0.8\\n\\nII\\nII\\nI;\\n\\n2\\n\\n1\\\\\\n\\nI ,\\n\\n;to.6\\n~\\n\\n~~~~;::~-:.~~;:\\n\\nA\\n\\nN~O.4\\nw\\n\\n----- ---- ----- -- ---\\n\\nv\\n\\n0.2\\n\\nO'----~--~--~-----'-------'\\n\\no\\n\\n0.5\\n\\n1\\nA\\n\\n1.5\\n\\n2\\n\\nFigure 3: (a) Example for the encoding behavior with narrow tuning curves arranged on\\na regular lattice of dimension D = 1 (grid spacing ~).

Correspondingly, the total encoding error can be\\ndecreased by increasing an arbitrary number of edge lengths of the cube. The encoding by\\na population with a variability in the tuning curve geometries as described is more precise\\nthan that by a uniform population. This is true/or arbitrary D. Zhang and Sejnowski [13]\\nconsider the more artificial situation of a correlated variability ofthe tuning widths: tuning\\ncurves are always assumed to be radially symmetric. This is indicated by the diagonal\\nline in Fig. 1a. A distribution of tuning widths restricted to this subset yields an average\\npopulation Fisher information ex: (O'D-2) and does not improve the encoding for D = 2 or\\n\\nD=3.\\nFragmentation into D subpopulations. Finally, we study a family of distributions of\\ntuning widths which also yields a lower minimal encoding error than the uniform population. Let the density of tuning curves be given by\\n1 D\\n\\nPu(lT1,'\\\" ,lTD) = D\\n\\nL 6( lTi i=l\\n\\nAO')\\n\\nII 6(lTj - 0'),\\n\\n(14)\\n\\nj?-i\\n\\nwhere A > O. For A = 1, the population is uniform as in (7). For A :f. 1, the population\\nis split up into D subpopulations; in subpopulation i, lTi is modified while lTj == 0' for\\nj :f. i. See Fig. Id for an example. The diagonal elements ofthe average population Fisher\\ninformation are\\n\\n(Jii)u\\n\\n{1 + (D = f/DKtj)(F, T, D) -D-2\\nIT\\nDA\\n\\nI)A 2 }\\n\\n'\\n\\n(15)\\n\\nwhere the term in brackets will be abbreviated as 9D(A). (Jii)u does not depend on i in\\nthis case because of the symmetry in the sUbpopulations. Equation (15) and the uniform\\ncase (7) differ by 9D(A) which will now be discussed. Figure 3b shows 9D(A) for different\\nvalues of D. For A = 1, 9D(A) = 1 and (7) is recovered as expected. 9D(A) = 1\\nalso holds for A = 1/ (D - 1) < 1: narrowing one tuning width in each subpopulation\\nwill at first decrease the resolution provided D 2: 3; this is due to the fact that Ncode is\\ndecreased. For A < 1/(D - 1), however, 9D(A) > 1, and the resolution exceeds (Jii)u in\\n(7) because each neuron in the i-th subpopulation carries a high Fisher information in the\\ni-th dimension. D = 2 is a special case where no impairment of encoding occurs because\\nthe effect of a decrease of Ncode is less pronounced. Interestingly, an increase in A also\\nyields an improvement in the encoding accuracy. This is a combined effect resulting from\\nan increase in Ncode on the one hand and the existence of D subpopulations, D - 1 of\\n\\n\\fNeural Representation of Multi-Dimensional Stimuli\\n\\n121\\n\\nwhich maintain their tuning widths in each dimension on the other hand. The discussion\\nof 9D(>\\\") leads to the following encoding strategy. For small >.., (Jii)u increases rapidly,\\nwhich suggests a fragmentation of the population into D subpopulations each of which\\nencodes one feature with high accuracy, i.e., one tuning width in each subpopulation is\\nsmall whereas the remaining tuning widths are broad. Like in the case discussed above, the\\ntheoretical limit of this method is a breakdown of the approximation of TJ == const. and the\\nvalidity of (6) due to insufficient receptive field overlap.\\n\\n4 Discussion and Outlook\\nWe have discussed the effects of a variation of the tuning widths on the encoding accuracy\\nobtained by a population of stochastically spiking neurons. The question of an optimal\\ntuning strategy has turned out to be more complicated than previously assumed. More\\nspecifically, the case which focused most attention in the literature - radially symmetric\\nreceptive fields [5, 1,9, 3, 13] - yields a worse encoding accuracy than most other cases we\\nhave studied: uniform populations with tuning curves which are not radially symmetric;\\ndistributions of tuning curves around some symmetric or non-symmetric tuning curve; and\\nthe fragmentation of the population into D subpopulations each of which is specialized in\\none stimulus feature.\\nIn a next step, the theoretical results will be compared to empirical data on encoding properties of neural popUlations. One aspect is the existence of sensory maps which consist\\nof neural subpopulations with characteristic tuning properties for the features which are\\nrepresented. For example, receptive fields of auditory neurons in the midbrain of the barn\\nowl have elongated shapes [6]. A second aspect concerns the short-term dynamics of receptive fields. Using single-unit recordings in anaesthetized cats, Worgotter et al. [12]\\nobserved changes in receptive field size taking place in 50-lOOms. Our findings suggest\\nthat these dynamics alter the resolution obtained for the corresponding stimulus features.\\nThe observed effect may therefore realize a mechanism of an adaptable selective signal\\nprocessing.\\n\\nReferences\\n[1] Baldi, P. & HeiJigenberg, W.

We show that we can use searches for\\nthe words in a dictionary to identify portions of the document whose\\ntranscriptions are unambiguous. Using templates extracted from those\\nregions, we retrain our character prediction model to drastically improve\\nour search retrieval performance for words in the document.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\nAn active area of research in machine transcription of handwritten documents is reducing\\nthe amount and expense of supervised data required to train prediction models. Traditional\\nOCR techniques require a large sample of hand segmented letter glyphs for training. This\\nper character segmentation is expensive and often impractical to acquire, particularly if the\\ncorpora in question contain documents in many different scripts.\\nNumerous authors have presented methods for reducing the expense of training data by\\nremoving the need to segment individual characters. Both Kopec et al [3] and LeCun et al\\n[5] have presented models that take as input images of lines of text with their ASCII transcriptions. Training with these datasets is made possible by explicitly modelling possible\\nsegmentations in addition to having a model for character templates.\\nIn their research on ?wordspotting?, Lavrenko et al [4] demonstrate that images of entire\\nwords can be highly discriminative, even when the individual characters composing the\\nword are locally ambiguous. This implies that images of many sufficiently long words\\nshould have unambiguous transcriptions, even when the character models are poorly tuned.\\nIn our previous work, [2], the discriminatory power of whole words allowed us to achieve\\nstrong search results with a model trained on a single example per character.\\nThe above results have shown that A) one can learn new template models given images of\\ntext lines and their associated transcriptions, [3, 5] without needing an explicit segmentation\\nand that B) entire words can often be identified unambiguously, even when the models for\\nindividual characters are poorly tuned. [2, 4]. The first of these two points implies that\\ngiven a transcription, we can learn new character models. The second implies that for at\\nleast some parts of a document, we should be able to provide that transcription ?for free?,\\nby matching against a dictionary of known words.\\n\\n\\fs1\\n\\ns2\\n\\ns3\\n\\ns4\\n\\ns5\\n\\ns6\\n\\ns7\\n\\ns8\\n\\n?d\\n\\ndi\\n\\nix\\n\\nxe\\n\\ner\\n\\nri\\n\\nis\\n\\ns?\\n\\nFigure 1: A line, and the states that generate it. Each state st is defined by its left and\\nright characters ctl and ctr (eg ?x? and ?e? for s4 ). In the image, a state spans half of each\\nof these two characters, starting just past the center of the left character and extending to\\nthe center of the right character, i.e. the right half of the ?x? and the left half of the ?e?\\nin s4 . The relative positions of the two characters is given by a displacement vector dt\\n(superimposed on the image as white lines). Associating states with intracharacter spaces\\ninstead of with individual characters allows for the bounding boxes of characters to overlap\\nwhile maintaining the independence properties of the Markov chain.\\nIn this work we combine these two observations in order to improve character models\\nwithout the need for a document specific transcription. We provide a generic dictionary of\\nwords in the target language. We then identify ?high confidence? regions of a document.\\nThese are image regions for which exactly one word from our dictionary scores highly\\nunder our model. Given a set of high confidence regions, we effectively have a training\\ncorpus of text images with associated transcriptions. In these regions, we infer a segmentation and extract new character examples. Finally, we use these new exemplars to learn\\nan improved character prediction model. As in [2], our document in this work is a 12th\\ncentury manuscript of Terence?s Comedies obtained from Oxford?s Bodleian library [1].\\n\\n2 The Model\\nHidden Markov Models are a natural and widely used method for modeling images of text.\\nIn their simplest incarnation, a hidden state represents a character and the evidence variable\\nis some feature vector calculated at points along the line. If all characters were known to\\nbe of a single fixed width, this model would suffice. The probability of a line under this\\nmodel is given as\\nY\\np(line) = p(c1 |?)\\np(ct |ct?1 )p(im[w?(t?1):w?t]|ct )\\n(1)\\nt>1\\n\\nwhere ct represents the tth character on the line, ? represents the start state, w is the width\\nof a character, and im[w(t?1)+1:wt] represents the column of pixels beginning at column\\nw ? (t ? 1) + 1 of the image and ending at column w ? t, (i.e. the set of pixels spanned by\\nc)\\nUnfortunately, character?s widths do vary quite substantially and so we must extend the\\nmodel to accommodate different possible segmentations. A generalized HMM allows us to\\ndo this. In this model a hidden state is allowed to emit a variable length series of evidence\\nvariables. We introduce an explicit distribution over the possible widths of a character.\\nLetting dt be the displacement vector associated with the tth character, and ctx refer to the\\nx location of the left edge of a character on the line, the probability of a line under this\\nrevised model is\\nY\\np(line) = p(c1 |?)\\np(ct |ct?1 )p(dt |ct )p(im[ctx +1:ctx +d] |dt , ct )\\n(2)\\nt>1\\n\\nThis is the model we used in [2]. It performs far better than using an assumption of fixed\\nwidths, but it still imposes unrealistic constraints on the relative positions of characters. In\\n\\n\\fparticular, the portion of the ink generated by the current character is assumed to be independent of the preceding character. In other words, the model assumes that the bounding\\nboxes of characters do not overlap. This constraint is obviously unrealistic. Characters\\nroutinely overlap in our documents. ?f?s, for instance, form ligatures with most following characters. In previous work, we treated this overlap as noise, hurting our ability to\\ncorrectly localize templates. Under this model, local errors of alignment would also often propagate globally, adversely affecting the segmentation of the whole line. For search,\\nthis noisy segmentation still provides acceptable results. In this work, however, we need\\nto extract new templates, and thus correct localization and segmentation of templates is\\ncrucial.\\nIn our current work, we have relaxed this constraint, allowing characters to partially overlap. We achieve this by changing hidden states to represent character bigrams instead of\\nsingle characters (Figure 1). In the image, a state now spans the pixels from just past the\\ncenter of the left character to the pixel containing the center of the right character. We\\nadjust our notation somewhat to reflect this change, letting st now represent the tth hidden state and ctl and ctr be the left and right characters associated with s. dt is now the\\ndisplacement vector between the centers of ctl and ctr .\\nThe probability of a line under this, our actual, model is\\nY\\np(line) = p(s1 |?)\\np(st |st?1 )p(dt |ctl , ctr )p(im[stx +1:stx +dt ]|ctl , ctr , dt )\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nt>1\\n\\nThis model allows overlap of bounding boxes, but it does still make the assumption that\\nthe bounding box of the current character does not extend past the center of the previous\\ncharacter. This assumption does not fully reflect reality either. In Figure 1, for example,\\nthe left descender of the x extends back further than the center of the preceding character.\\nIt does, however, accurately reflect the constraints within the heart of the line (excluding\\nascenders and descenders). In practice, it has proven to generate very accurate segmentations. Moreover, the errors we do encounter no longer tend to affect the entire line, since\\nthe model has more flexibility with which to readjust back to the correct segmentation.\\n2.1 Model Parameters\\nOur transition distribution between states is simply a 3-gram character model. We train this\\nmodel using a collection of ASCII Latin documents collected from the web. This set does\\nnot include the transcriptions of our documents.\\nConditioned on displacement vector, the emission model for generating an image chunk\\ngiven a state is a mixture of gaussians. We associate with each character a set of image\\nwindows extracted from various locations in the document. We initialize these sets with\\none example a piece from our hand cut set (Figure 2). We adjust the probability of an image\\ngiven the state to include the distribution over blocks by expanding the last term of Equation\\n3 to reflect this mixture. Letting bck represent the k th exemplar in the set associated with\\ncharacter c, the conditional probability of an image region spanning the columns from x to\\nx? is given as\\nX\\np(imx:x? |ctl , ctr , dt ) =\\np(imx:x? |bctl i , bctr j , dt )\\n(4)\\ni,j\\n\\nIn principle, the displacement vectors should now be associated with an individual block,\\nnot a character. This is especially true when we have both upper and lower case letters.\\nHowever, our model does not seem particularly sensitive to this displacement distribution\\nand so in practice, we have a single, fairly loose, displacement distribution per character.\\nGiven a displacement vector, we can generate the maximum likelihood template image\\nunder our model by compositing the correct halves of the left and right blocks. Reshaping\\n\\n\\fthe image window into a vector, the likelihood of an image window is then modeled as\\na gaussian, using the corresponding pixels in the template as the means, and assuming\\na diagonal covariance matrix. The covariance matrix largely serves to mask out empty\\nregions of a character?s bounding box, so that we do not pay a penalty when the overlap of\\ntwo characters? bounding boxes contains only whitespace.\\n2.2 Efficiency Considerations\\nThe number of possible different templates for a state is O(|B| ? |B| ? |D|), where |B| is\\nthe number of different possible blocks and |D| is the number of candidate displacement\\nvectors. To make inference in this model computationally feasible, we first restrict the\\ndomain of d. For a given pair of blocks bl and br , we consider only displacement vectors\\nwithin some small x distance from a mean displacement mbl ,br , and we have a uniform\\ndistribution within this region. m is initialized from the known size of our single hand cut\\ntemplate. In the current work, we do not relearn the m. These are held fixed and assumed\\nto be the same for all blocks associated with the same letter.\\nEven when restricting the number of d?s under consideration as discussed above, it is computationally infeasible to consider every possible location and pair of blocks. We therefore\\nprune our candidate locations by looking at the likelihood of blocks in isolation and only\\nconsidering locations where there is a local optimum in the response function and whose\\nvalue is better than a given threshold. In this case our threshold for a given location is that\\nL(block) < .7L(background) (where L(x) represents the negative log likelihood of x).\\nIn other words, a location has to look at least marginally more like a given block than it\\nlooks like the background.\\nAfter pruning locations in this manner, we are left with a discrete set of ?sites,? where we\\ndefine a site as the tuple (block type, x location, y location). We can enumerate the set of\\npossible states by looking at every pair of sites whose displacement vector has a non-zero\\nprobability.\\n2.3 Inference In The Model\\nThe statespace defined above is a directed acyclic graph, anchored at the left edge and\\nright edges of a line of text. A path through this lattice defines both a transcription and\\na segmentation of the line into individual characters. Inference in this model is relatively\\nstraightforward because of our constraint that each character may overlap only one preceding and one following character, and our restriction of displacement vectors to a small\\ndiscrete range. The first restriction means that we need only consider binary relations between templates. The second preserves the independence relationships of an HMM. A\\ngiven state st is independent of the rest of the line given the values of all other states within\\ndmax of either edge of st (where dmax is the legal displacement vector with the longest\\nx component.) We can therefore easily calculate the best path or explicitly calculate the\\nposterior of a node by traversing the state graph in topological order, sorted from left to\\nright. The literature on Weighted Finite State Transducers ([6], [5]) is a good resource for\\nefficient algorithms on these types of statespace graph.\\n\\n3 Learning Better Character Templates\\nWe initialize our algorithm with a set of handcut templates, exactly 1 per character, (Figure\\n2), and our goal is to construct more accurate character models automatically from unsupervised data. As noted above, we can easily calculate the posterior of a given site under\\nour model. (Recall that a site is a particular character template at a given (x,y) location in\\nthe line.) The traditional EM approach to estimating new templates would be to use these\\n\\n\\fFigure 2: Original Training Data These 22 glyphs are our only document specific training\\ndata. We use the model based on these characters to extract the new examples shown below\\n\\nFigure 3: Examples of extracted templates We extract new templates from high confidence\\nregions. From these, we choose a subset to incorporate into the model as new exemplars.\\nTemplates are chosen iteratively to best cover the space of training examples. Notice that\\nfor ?q? and ?a?, we have extracted capital letters, of which there were no examples in\\nour original set of glyphs. This happens when the combination of constraints from the\\ndictionary the surrounding glyphs make a ?q? or ?a? the only possible explanation for\\nthis region, even though its local likelihood is poor.\\n\\nsites as training examples, weighted by their posteriors. Unfortunately, the constraints imposed by 3 and even 4-gram character models seem to be insufficient. The posteriors of\\nsites are not discriminative enough to get learning off the ground.\\nThe key to successfully learning new templates lies is the observation from our previous\\nwork [2], that even when the posteriors of individual characters are not discriminative, one\\ncan still achieve very good search results with the same model. The search word in effect\\nserves as its own language model, only allowing paths through the state graph that actually\\ncontain it, and the longer the word the more it constrains the model. Whole words impose\\nmuch tighter constraints than a 2 or 3-gram character model, and it is only with this added\\npower that we can successfully learn new character templates.\\nWe define the score for a search as the negative log likelihood of the best path containing\\nthat word. With sufficiently long words, it becomes increasingly unlikely that a spurious\\npath will achieve a high score. Moreover, if we are given a large dictionary of words and\\nno alternative word explains a region of ink nearly as well as the best scoring word, then\\nwe can be extremely confident that this is a true transcription of that piece of ink.\\nStarting with a weak character model, we do not expect to find many of these ?high confidence? regions, but with a large enough document, we should expect to find some. From\\nthese regions, we can extract new, reliable templates with which to improve our character\\nmodels. The most valuable of these new templates will be those that are significantly different from any in our current set. For example, in Figure 3, note that our system identifies\\ncapital Q?s, even though our only input template was lower case. It identifies this ink as\\na Q in much the same way that a person solves a crossword puzzle. We can easily infer\\nthe missing character in the string ?obv-ous? because the other letters constrain us to one\\npossible solution. Similarly, if other character templates in a word match well, then we can\\nunambiguously identify the other, more ambiguous ones. In our Latin case, ?Quid? is the\\nonly likely explanation for ?-uid?.\\n3.1 Extracting New Templates and Updating The Model\\nWithin a high confidence region we have both a transcription and a localization of template\\ncenters. It remains only to cut out new templates. We accomplish this by creating a template\\nimage for the column of pixels from the corresponding block templates and then assigning\\nimage pixels to the nearest template character (measured by Euclidean distance).\\nGiven a set of templates extracted from high confidence regions, we choose a subset of\\n\\n\\fScore Under Model\\n\\nworse\\n3400\\n3350\\n3300\\nbest\\nConfidence Margins\\n\\nFigure 4: Each line segment in the lower figure represents a proposed location for a word\\nfrom our dictionary. It?s vertical height is the score of that location under our model. A\\nlower score represents a better fit. The dotted line is the score of our model?s best possible\\npath. Three correct words, ?nec?, ?quin? and ?dari?, are actually on the best path. We\\ndefine the confidence margin of a location as the difference in score between the best\\nfitting word from our dictionary and the next best.\\n\\nFigure 5: Extracting Templates For a region with sufficiently high confidence margin, we\\nconstruct the maximum likelihood template from our current exemplars. left, and we assign\\npixels from the original image to a template based on its distance to the nearest pixel in\\nthe template image, extracting new glyph exemplars right. These new glyphs become the\\nexemplars for our next round of training.\\n\\ntemplates that best explain the remaining examples. We do this in a greedy fashion by\\nchoosing the example whose likelihood is lowest under our current model and adding it to\\nour set. Currently, we threshold the number of new templates for the sake of efficiency. Finally, given the new set of templates, we can add them to the model and rerun our searches,\\npotentially identifying new high confidence regions.\\n\\n4 Results\\nOur algorithm iteratively improves the character model by gathering new training data from\\nhigh confidence regions. Figure 3 shows that this method finds new templates significantly\\ndifferent from the originals. In this document, our set of examples after one round appears\\nto cover the space of character images well, at least those in lower case. Our templates are\\nnot perfect. The ?a?, for instance, has become associated with at least one block that is in\\nfact an ?o?. These mistakes are uncommon, particularly if we restrict ourselves to longer\\nwords. Those that do occur introduce a tolerable level noise into our model. They make\\ncertain regions of the document more ambiguous locally, but that local ambiguity can be\\novercome with the context provided by surrounding characters and a language model.\\nImproved Character Models We evaluate the method more quantitatively by testing the\\nimpact of the new templates on the quality of searches performed against the document.\\nTo search for a given word, we rank lines by the ratio of the maximum likelihood transcription/segmentation that contains the search word to the likelihood of the best possible\\nsegmentation/transcription under our model. The lowest possible search score is 1, happening when the search word is actually a substring of the maximum likelihood transcription.\\nHigher scores mean that the word is increasingly unlikely under our model. In Figure 7, the\\nfigure on the left shows the improvement in ranking of the lines that truly contain selected\\nsearch words. The odd rows (in red) are search results using only the original 22 glyphs,\\n\\n\\f20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\n100\\n\\n200\\n\\n300\\n\\n400\\n\\n500\\n\\n600\\n\\nRnd 2\\n\\nRnd 1\\n\\n2700\\n2650\\n2600\\ndotted (wrong):\\nsolid (correct):\\n1920\\n1900\\n1880\\n1860\\n1840\\ndotted (wrong):\\nsolid (correct):\\n\\niam\\n\\nnupta\\nnuptiis\\n\\ninquam\\n\\n(v|u)ideo\\nvidet\\n\\nnupta\\nnuptiis\\n\\npost inquam\\npostquam\\n\\n(v|u)ideo\\nvidet\\n\\nFigure 6: Search Results with (Rnd 1) initial templates only and with (Rnd 2) templates\\nextracted from high confidence regions. We show results that have a score within 5% of the\\nbest path. Solid Lines are the results for the correct word. Dotted lines represent other\\nsearch results, where we have made a few larger in order to show those words that are\\nthe closest competitors to the true word. Many alternative searches, like the highlighted\\n?post? are actually portions of the correct larger words. These restrict our selection of\\nconfidence regions, but do not impinge on search quality.\\nEach correct word has significantly improved after one round of template reestimation.\\n?iam? has been correctly identified, and is a new high confidence region. Both ?nuptiis?\\nand ?postquam? are now the highest likelihood words for their region barring smaller\\nsubsequences, and ?videt? has narrowed the gap between its competitor ?video?.\\nwhile the even rows (in green) use an additional 332 glyphs extracted from high confidence\\nregions. Search results are markedly improved in the second model. The word ?est?, for\\ninstance, only had 15 of 24 of the correct lines in the top 100 under the original model,\\nwhile under the learned model all 24 are not only present but also more highly ranked.\\nImproved Search Figure 6 shows the improved performance of our refitted model for\\na single line. Most words have greatly improved relative to their next best alternative.\\n?postquam? and ?iam? were not even considered by the original model and now are nearly\\noptimal. The right of Figure 7 shows the average precision/recall curve under each model\\nfor 21 words with more than 4 occurrences in the dataset. Precision is the percentage\\nof lines truly containing a word in the top n search results, and recall is the percentage\\nof all lines containing the word returned in the top n results. The learned model clearly\\ndominates. The new model also greatly improves performance for rare words. For 320\\nwords ocurring just once in the dataset, 50% are correctly returned as the top ranked result\\nunder the original model. Under the learned model, this number jumps to 78%.\\n\\n5 Conclusions and Future Work\\nIn most fonts, characters are quite ambiguous locally. An ?n? looks like a ?u?, looks like\\n?ii?, etc. This ambiguity is the major hurdle to the unsupervised learning of character\\ntemplates. Language models help, but the standard n-gram models provide insufficient\\nconstraints, giving posteriors for character sites too uninformative to get EM off the ground.\\n\\n\\fAggregate Precision/Recall Curve\\n\\nSelected Words, Top 100 Returned Lines\\n\\nPrecision\\n\\nest\\n(15,24)/24\\nnescio\\n( 1, 1)/ 1\\npostquam\\n( 0, 2)/ 2\\nquod\\n(14,14)/14\\nmoram\\n( 0, 2)/ 2\\nnon\\n( 8, 8)/ 8\\nquid\\n( 9, 9)/ 9\\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90100\\n\\n0.75\\n0.7\\n0.65\\n0.6\\n0.55\\n0.5\\n0.45\\n0.4\\n0.35\\n\\nOriginal Model\\nRefit Model\\n0.2\\n\\n0.4\\n0.6\\nRecall\\n\\n0.8\\n\\n1\\n\\nFigure 7: The figure on the left shows the those lines with the top 100 scores that actually\\ncontain the specified word. The first of each set of two rows (in red) is the results from\\nRound 1. The second (in green) is the results for Round 2. Almost all search words in our\\ncorpus show a significant improvement. The numbers to the right (x/y) mean that out of\\ny lines that actually contained the search word in our document, x of them made it into\\nthe top ten. On the right are average precision/recall curves for 21 high frequency words\\nunder the model with our original templates (Rnd 1) and after refitting with new extracted\\ntemplates (Rnd 2). Extracting new templates vastly improves our search quality\\nAn entire word is much different. Given a dictionary, we expect many word images to have\\na single likely transcription even if many characters are locally ambiguous. We show that\\nwe can identify these high confidence regions even with a poorly tuned character model. By\\nextracting new templates only from these regions of the document, we overcome the noise\\nproblem and significantly improve our character models. We demonstrate this improvement\\nfor the task of search where the refitted models have drastically better search responses than\\nwith the original. Our method is indifferent to the form of the actual character emission\\nmodel. There is a rich literature in character prediction from isolated image windows, and\\nwe expect that incorporating more powerful character models should provide even greater\\nreturns and help us in learning less regular scripts.\\nFinding high confidence regions to extract good training examples is a broadly applicable concept. We believe this work should extend to other problems, most notably speech\\nrecognition. Looked at more abstractly, our use of language model in this work is actually encoding spatial constraints. The probability of a character given an image window\\ndepends not only on the identify of surrounding characters but also on their spatial configuration. Integrating context into recognition problems is an area of intense research in\\nthe computer vision community, and we are investigating extending the idea of confidence\\nregions to more general object recognition problems.\\n\\nReferences\\n[1] Early Manuscripts at Oxford University.
