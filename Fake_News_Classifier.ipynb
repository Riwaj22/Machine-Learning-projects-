The timing of Cohen\\u2019s testimony was first reported by NBC. Cohen confirmed that he would testify to the committee on Tuesday and said he did not know whether it would be in a closed session or public. Aides to the committee\\u2019s leaders did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Cohen said previously he had received a subpoena from at least one of the congressional committees investigating what U.S. intelligence has determined were Russia\\u2019s efforts to influence the election on Trump\\u2019s behalf, and whether Trump associates colluded with Russia. Russia denies such activity. The White House denies any collusion, but concerns about the issue and Trump\\u2019s ties to Russia have shadowed the first months of the Republican\\u2019s presidency. Cohen, a personal attorney to Trump, would be one of a series of close associates of the president to testify in Congress. Members of both the Senate and House of Representatives committees conducting investigations have said they expect to call more. Trump\\u2019s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month. \",\n          \"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s main opposition leader said on Monday President Robert Mugabe s refusal to resign had dampened people s spirits and called for an inclusive political process in the aftermath of a military intervention last week.

It s owned by an African American owner, but he gives full authority to the Hispanics to run it,  Beasley told reporters.  It just caught me by surprise because here I am getting fired when I m trying to fix the problem. Beasley was frustrated that his complaints to management never got addressed, so he sued.  It s owned by an African American owner, but he gives full authority to the Hispanics to run it,  he told reporters.  It just caught me by surprise because here I am getting fired when I m trying to fix the problem. Beasley explained to CBS that he became homeless after he lost his job, so the hefty settlement becomes a huge victory for the grandfather from Compton.His lawyer Scott Cummings hopes that this win sends a message to other businesses out there.  Racism, racial harassment can occur really anywhere even in a black-owned business,  he asserted. Beasley added,  You can t treat people like that and get away with it constantly.

[The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has yet to score the Ryan plan, although the Brookings Institution\\u2019s report does not bode well for the House leadership\\u2019s bill.  The Ryan plan reports, \\u201cWe conclude that CBO\\u2019s analysis will likely estimate that at least 15 million people will lose coverage under the American Health Care Act (AHCA) by the end of the   scoring window. Estimates could be higher, but it\\u2019s [sic] is unlikely they will be significantly lower. \\u201d The Kaiser Family Foundation states that the Ryan plan\\u2019s tax credits aid wealthier Americans more than   individuals. Older Americans would face comparatively less aid through tax credits than younger counterparts. American Medical Association CEO James Madara also criticized the Republican leadership\\u2019s tax credits, saying, \\u201cWe believe credits inversely related to income, rather than age as proposed in the committee\\u2019s legislation, not only result in greater numbers of people insured but are a more efficient use of   resources. \\u201d Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady ( ) has maintained that tax credits help everyone get covered. He said, \\u201cIt covers more people, because it applies to those who don\\u2019t have a tax liability, and it\\u2019s advanceable, so it\\u2019s available today. \\u201d Avik Roy, a health expert at Forbes, argued that tax credits in the Ryan plan will \\u201cprice many poor and vulnerable people out of the health insurance market. \\u201d Michael Cannon, the Cato Institute\\u2019s director of health policy studies, believes that the GOP\\u2019s Obamacare replacement bill will force the poor to lose their coverage. He lamented, \\u201cIf the tax credits (read: subsidies) for   Americans are less than under Obamacare, many more   patients will lose coverage. Premiums will continue to rise. Republicans will take the blame for all of it, because they will have failed to repeal Obamacare, or learn its lessons, when they had the chance. \\u201d\",\n          \"At least six members of the Super   New England Patriots have said they will not visit the White House for the traditional meeting that championship teams have with the president. Running back LeGarrette Blount, defensive end Chris Long and defensive tackle Alan Branch on Thursday became the latest to announce that they would skip the visit. Long posted on Twitter that he \\u201cplanned on skipping\\u201d in response to a column in The Daily News that urged him to skip. Blount revealed his decision on Fox Sports in a radio interview on \\u201cThe Rich Eisen Show\\u201d later in the afternoon. \\u201cI just don\\u2019t feel welcome in that house,\\u201d Blount said. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to just leave it at that. \\u201d Branch told Sirius XM Radio that he planned to spend time with family. A day earlier, the Pro Bowl linebacker Dont\\u2019a Hightower bowed out when he told ESPN, \\u201cBeen there, done that,\\u201d having visited with a championship Alabama team. Tight end Martellus Bennett told reporters after the Super Bowl that he would not go: \\u201cIt is what it is,\\u201d he said. \\u201cPeople know how I feel about it. Just follow me on Twitter. \\u201d The outspoken Bennett had joked that he might move to outer space after Donald J. Trump was elected. The Pro Bowl safety Devin McCourty, a team captain,  told Time magazine: \\u201cBasic reason for me is I don\\u2019t feel accepted in the White House. With the president having so many strong opinions and prejudices, I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won\\u2019t. \\u201d Bennett and McCourty were in the news for their activism last fall, when they raised their fists in protest during the national anthem for one game. At the time, athletes in various sports were protesting racial oppression in the country. The number of Patriots absences may well increase. Running back James White said he had not made up his mind whether to go. \\u201cI\\u2019ll wait till the time comes and decide then,\\u201d he said. No date has been scheduled for this year\\u2019s ceremony honoring the Patriots. The ceremony for last year\\u2019s champions, the Broncos, took place in June. Perhaps no other team has as close an association with Trump as the Patriots. Just before the election, Trump claimed that he had the support of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Coach Bill Belichick. Brady, who displayed a \\u201cMake America Great Again\\u201d cap in his locker during the campaign, never explicitly endorsed Trump, but he spoke favorably of him and they have socialized. Trump also cited a supportive letter he had received from Belichick, and several news media accounts confirmed the letter was authentic. The team\\u2019s owner, Robert K. Kraft, has said he has considered Trump a longtime friend. Brady did not attend his team\\u2019s visit with former President Barack Obama at the White House, in 2015, citing family issues. But some athletes who have skipped the trip over the years have explicitly given politics as a reason. Bruins goalie Tim Thomas declined to visit the Obama White House with his teammates in January 2012, saying in a statement: \\u201cI believe the federal government has grown out of control, threatening the rights, liberties and property of the people. \\u201cBecause I believe this, today I exercised my right as a free citizen, and did not visit the White House. \\u201d Baltimore Ravens center Matt Birk cited his opposition to abortion as the reason for skipping a 2013 visit. A number of other athletes have skipped the ceremony while citing scheduling conflicts or family commitments. Presidents for years have invited sports figures to the White House, but the tradition of honoring championships teams there solidified under Ronald Reagan. Major professional champions and many college champions stop by for a presentation and a photo opportunity. Six Patriots, so far, won\\u2019t make the trip this year.\",\n          \"SAN FRANCISCO  \\u2014   By mastering some tough computer chip technology and then pulling off an audacious business strategy based on selling its smartphone knowledge, Qualcomm has made billions of dollars and seized influence in the tech industry. Some days that is a real drag. On Friday, Apple, its longtime partner, sued Qualcomm over what it said was $1 billion in withheld rebates. In the lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court for the Southern District of California, in San Diego, Apple said the money had been promised in conjunction with an agreement not to buy chips from other suppliers or to divulge Qualcomm\\u2019s intellectual property licensing practices. The suit seeks the rebates, among other things. Apple sued three days after the  Federal Trade Commission accused Qualcomm of using anticompetitive practices to guarantee its high royalty payments for advanced wireless technology. The commission cited Qualcomm\\u2019s deals with Taiwanese companies that manufacture Apple iPhones over semiconductors it sells for the iPhone. In its complaint, the commission described Qualcomm as \\u201cthe world\\u2019s dominant supplier\\u201d of semiconductors that manage smartphone communications. The commission said Qualcomm had obtained \\u201celevated royalties\\u201d for its patented intellectual property on wireless communications. Other smartphone chip makers have to pay Qualcomm for that intellectual property, too. The commission and Apple complaints follow several other problems, including a $975 million fine by Chinese regulators in 2015 and activist shareholder complaints later that year that forced layoffs at Qualcomm. Last month, Qualcomm was fined $850 million in South Korea for unfair patent licensing. When Apple provided information to South Korean regulators in that case, and sought competing chips from Intel, Qualcomm refused to pay Apple its promised money, Apple said. Qualcomm has vowed to fight the South Korean charge and the F. T. C. suit. \\u201cApple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations,\\u201d Qualcomm said in a statement, adding that it would fight that lawsuit, too. Few expect Qualcomm to back down. It was shaped by its founders to be brainy, combative and profitable. \\u201cThey are seasoned, and equipped to fight,\\u201d said Mark Hung, an analyst at Gartner. \\u201cBut when such a big company is so reliant on the way it sells its intellectual property, and under the microscope in various geographies, it\\u2019s tough. \\u201d Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego, far from Silicon Valley, was founded in 1985 by seven people, including Irwin Jacobs and Andrew Viterbi. The two were   electrical engineering professors who had formed a military satellite communications company. Qualcomm\\u2019s engineers work at a   campus between a park and the University of California, San Diego. They have earned thousands of patents, including for the airplane mode on smartphones and the way apps are downloaded from stores. Companies like Samsung and Apple need Qualcomm for the technology that enables things like   wireless video for millions of people at once. Its major technology is spread spectrum, which harnesses lots of computation and clever radio engineering for use in the various functions of smartphones. Qualcomm\\u2019s radio technology is called CDMA, for code division multiple access, a way voice calls work more efficiently over cellphone networks. And the company\\u2019s influence grew over the last several years with the advent of   or 3G, phones as people started downloading lots of mobile data as well as making calls. At the time, many thought Qualcomm\\u2019s success would be limited to that transition. Instead, Qualcomm innovated in 4G wireless for the new smartphones from Samsung and Apple that toppled Nokia and Motorola. In its last fiscal year, Qualcomm had revenue of $23. 6 billion and a profit of $5. 7 billion. Qualcomm\\u2019s ventures in phones and network gear helped promote CDMA but did not make much money because older companies did not need CDMA until the success of wireless began to tax the capacity of their networks. Qualcomm turned to Asian companies that wanted to get into wireless. \\u201cYou\\u2019d never have seen the Koreans or the Chinese in wireless if not for Qualcomm and CDMA,\\u201d said Clint McClellan, a   employee of Qualcomm who now runs a wireless health business. \\u201cWe enabled those markets. \\u201d South Korea, in particular, made CDMA an industrial policy, which carried Qualcomm for years. More recently, China accounted for half of Qualcomm\\u2019s revenue. Apple\\u2019s Taiwanese manufacturers, which pay Qualcomm royalties for iPhones, are another big profit center. Qualcomm would not say what it charges for its intellectual property, but analysts figure the fee usually amounts to 5 percent of the selling price of a phone  \\u2014   at least it did, until the 2015 Chinese fine, which included an agreement that Chinese manufacturers pay only about half the old Qualcomm royalty. That, and problems collecting Chinese royalties even before the agreement, hurt Qualcomm\\u2019s share price. In 2015, Jana Partners, an activist hedge fund, stepped in and pressed for a breakup of the company into separate intellectual property and chip businesses. That did not happen, but Qualcomm cut about 15 percent of its staff, cut executive pay and gave Jana three board seats. The stock has recovered to about where it was just before the fine, but not to the heights it reached before the problems. By helping to create today\\u2019s smartphone giants, Qualcomm may have engineered its current woes. Qualcomm executives say they see a connection between the China discounts, which Qualcomm had hoped would be limited to that country, and the latest regulatory attacks. \\u201cWe believe Samsung had a major role to play in the Korean decision,\\u201d said Don Rosenberg, a lawyer for Qualcomm. The regulators, he said, \\u201cwere prodded and misled by commercial interests. \\u201d In an email,   Jee, a spokeswoman for Samsung, said it \\u201cwas one of many multinational corporations\\u201d that responded to questions from South Korean regulators. Qualcomm\\u2019s lawyer figures the Korean case may take years to move through the courts. And recent events, including the impeachment of South Korea\\u2019s president and a  bribery scandal at Samsung, could complicate, or eliminate, Qualcomm\\u2019s regulatory issues there. Additionally, the F. T. C. has just three of its normal five commissioners. One of those, Maureen Ohlhausen, a Republican, voted against the suit. She may be named chairwoman when the current chairwoman, Edith Ramirez, a Democrat, steps down on Feb. 10. Neither the F. T. C. nor Apple would comment on the United States case against Qualcomm. \\u201cIt\\u2019s disappointing when our partners want to pay less after we\\u2019ve contributed to their success,\\u201d said Derek Aberle, Qualcomm\\u2019s president. Now it must get out ahead of other technology inventors in 5G, possibly while paying billions in fines and dealing with a painful restructuring and fraying relationships with its biggest customers. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not sitting still\\u201d while the problems are sorted, Mr. Aberle said. \\u201cYou have to invest, and invent cool stuff that will change the way people live their lives. \\u201d In other words, create unique technology so people will keep paying for Qualcomm\\u2019s expensive intellectual property.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "Text Sample:  philadelphia reuters tom westerman voted for donald trump in last year s election but says he might not do so again after the president cut off billions of dollars in obamacare subsidies to health insurance companies it really upset me said westerman a self described middle class guy with an annual household income of about in the western pennsylvania city of arnold westerman s change of heart reflects mounting fears among middle class democrats and republicans that their health insurance costs will soar as trump weakens former president barack obama s signature healthcare law which extended insurance to more than million americans trump said last week he would stop paying the monthly subsidies which he has derided as a bailout of insurers the money reimburses insurers for discounts on deductibles copays and other out of pocket costs the firms still must provide under obamacare to low income households some insurers anticipating that trump would end the funding had already raised premiums on insurance plans under obama s affordable care act to recoup those funds others withdrew from obamacare markets in many states because of the uncertainty it seems like he is trying to hurt the middle class said westerman who is retired from a manufacturing company in pennsylvania a state that trump won by little more than votes over democrat hillary clinton it was the first time a republican candidate had won pennsylvania since westerman already pays a month in healthcare premiums and about a month for his year old daughter s college tuition he says he s going to make it better for everyone how does a premium increase make it better a white house spokesman declined to comment and referred inquiries to the u s department of health and human services which did not immediately respond to a request for comment trump has called subsidy payments a gift for insurance companies his administration has argued that it cannot lawfully make the payments unless congress passes new legislation some people said they were encouraged to see trump deliver on a campaign promise to dismantle obamacare after repeated failures by congressional republicans to repeal the law i support the president because i think obamacare is imploding and it not only impacts those on obamacare but everybody said roger heuring who lives in new jersey heuring is on an employer plan but said his sister in ohio buys insurance on the obamacare market forget the president it s the congress s responsibility they re the ones that passed this mess to begin with heuring said in addition to cutting subsidies trump signed an executive order last week that could eventually make it easier for americans to buy cheaper bare bones health insurance plans than required by obamacare on tuesday two senators struck a bipartisan deal to stabilize the obamacare market including reinstating the subsidies for two years trump initially said he might back the deal but reversed course on wednesday as senior republican lawmakers spoke out against a plan that might allow obamacare to survive meanwhile democratic attorneys general have asked a california judge to intervene and direct the administration to continue the payments until their legal challenge to trump s cutoff is settled in court the moves created new uncertainty over the subsidies just two weeks before americans begin to enroll in obamacare plans for middle class squeeze if the subsidies are not restored some middle income families and small business owners who buy insurance on the obamacare markets could see their premiums rise the most said larry levitt health economist at the kaiser family foundation these include cash strapped self employed workers who rely on obamacare to buy insurance but make too much money to qualify for government assistance the very poor receive other forms of government subsidies to buy coverage that shields them from premium increases karyn feit a self employed mental health therapist in philadelphia said a hike in premiums will strain her already stretched finances and force her to cut back on trips to florida to care for sick parents feit and her husband together earn annually placing her among america s vast tier of middle income families they bought obamacare individual coverage four years ago when feit left her job at a hospital to start her own business leaving her without employer coverage she has no children her current monthly premiums are she expects this to rise by a month after trump s decision the first thing i would have to cut is travel and caring for other people said feit a democrat trump voter stephen lewis lost his job as a veterinarian in wisconsin and bought a health insurance plan under obamacare lewis still supports trump although he said he fears that his premiums now a month could rise further with the subsidy cut making it harder for him to meet other expenses including in monthly mortgage

            "Text Sample: you must lose weight a doctor told sarah bramblette advising a diet but ms bramblette had a basic question how much do i weigh the doctor s scale went up to pounds and she was heavier than that if she did not know the number how would she know if the diet was working the doctor had no answer so ms bramblette who lived in ohio at the time resorted to a solution that made her burn with shame she drove to a nearby junkyard that had a scale that could weigh her she was pounds one in three americans is obese a rate that has been steadily growing for more than two decades but the health care system in its attitudes equipment and common practices is ill prepared and its practitioners are often unwilling to treat the rising population of fat patients the difficulties range from scales and scanners like m r i machines that are not built big enough for very heavy people to surgeons who categorically refuse to give knee or hip replacements to the obese to drug doses that have not been calibrated for obese patients the situation is particularly thorny for the more than million americans who have extreme obesity a body mass index of or higher and face a wide range of health concerns part of the problem both patients and doctors say is a reluctance to look beyond a fat person s weight patty nece of alexandria va went to an orthopedist because her hip was aching she had lost nearly pounds and although she still had a way to go was feeling good about herself until she saw the doctor he came to the door of the exam room and i started to tell him my symptoms ms nece said he said let me cut to the chase you need to lose weight the doctor she said never examined her but he made a diagnosis obesity pain and relayed it to her internist in fact she later learned she had progressive scoliosis a condition not caused by obesity dr louis j aronne an obesity specialist at weill cornell medicine helped found the american board of obesity medicine to address this sort of issue the goal is to help doctors learn how to treat obesity and serve as a resource for patients seeking doctors who can look past their weight when they have a medical problem dr aronne says patients recount stories like ms nece s to him all the time our patients say nobody has ever treated me like i have a serious problem they blow it off and tell me to go to weight watchers dr aronne said physicians need better education and they need a different attitude toward people who have obesity he said they need to recognize that this is a disease like diabetes or any other disease they are treating people for the issues facing obese people follow them through the medical system starting with the physical exam research has shown that doctors may spend less time with obese patients and fail to refer them for diagnostic tests one study asked primary care doctors affiliated with one of three hospitals within the texas medical center in houston about their attitudes toward obese patients the doctors reported that seeing patients was a greater waste of their time the heavier that they were that physicians would like their jobs less as their patients increased in size that heavier patients were viewed to be more annoying and that physicians felt less patience the heavier the patient was the researchers wrote other times doctors may be unwittingly influenced by unfounded assumptions attributing symptoms like shortness of breath to the person s weight without investigating other likely causes that happened to a patient who eventually went to see dr scott kahan an obesity specialist at georgetown university the patient a woman suddenly found it almost impossible to walk from her bedroom to her kitchen those few steps left her gasping for breath frightened she went to a local urgent care center where the doctor said she had a lot of weight pressing on her lungs the only thing wrong with her the doctor said was that she was fat i started to cry said the woman who asked not to be named to protect her privacy i said i don t have a sudden weight pressing on my lungs i m really scared i m not able to breathe that s the problem with obesity she said the doctor told her have you ever considered going on a diet it turned out that the woman had several small blood clots in her lungs a condition dr kahan said for many the next step in a diagnosis involves a scan like a ct or m r i but many extremely heavy people cannot fit in the scanners which depending on the model typically have weight limits of to pounds scanners that can handle very heavy people are manufactured but one national survey found that at least percent of emergency rooms did not have them even four in five community hospitals that were deemed bariatric surgery centers of excellence lacked scanners that could handle very heavy people yet ct or m r i imaging is needed to evaluate patients with a variety of ailments including trauma acute abdominal pain lung blood clots and strokes when an obese patient cannot fit in a scanner doctors may just give up some use to scan hoping for the best others resort to more extreme measures dr kahan said another doctor had sent one of his patients to a zoo for a scan she was so humiliated that she declined requests for an interview problems do not end with a diagnosis with treatments uncertainties continue to abound in cancer for example obese patients tend to have worse outcomes and a higher risk of death a difference that holds for every type of cancer the disease of obesity might exacerbate cancer said dr clifford hudis the chief executive officer of the american society of clinical oncology but he added another reason for poor outcomes in obese cancer patients is almost certainly that medical care is compromised drug doses are usually based on standard body sizes or surface areas the definition of a standard size dr hudis said is often based on data involving people from decades ago when the average person was thinner for fat people that might lead to underdosing for some drugs but it is hard to know without studying specific drug effects in heavier people and such studies are generally not done without that data if someone does not respond to a cancer drug it is impossible to know whether the dose was wrong or the patient s tumor was just resisting the drug one of the most frequent medical problems in obese patients is arthritis of the hip or knee it is so common in fact that most patients arriving at orthopedists offices in agonizing pain from hip or knee arthritis are obese but many orthopedists will not offer surgery unless the patients first lose weight said dr adolph j yates jr an orthopedics professor at the university of pittsburgh school of medicine there are offices that will screen by phone dr yates said they will ask for weight and height and tell patients before they see them that they can t help them but how well grounded are those weight limits there is a perception among some surgeons that it is more difficult and certainly some felt it was an added risk to operate on very obese people dr yates said he was a member of a committee that reviewed the risks and benefits of joint replacement in obese patients for the american association of hip and knee surgeons the group concluded that heavy patients should first be counseled to lose weight because a lower weight reduces stress on the joints and can alleviate pain without surgery but there should not be blanket refusals to operate on fat people the committee wrote those with a body mass index over like a woman weighing pounds or a man weighing and who cannot lose weight should be informed that their risks are greater but they should not be categorically dismissed the group concluded dr yates said he had successfully operated on people with body mass indexes as high as what is behind the refusals to operate he said is that doctors and hospitals have become because they fear their ratings will fall if too many patients have complications a lower score can mean reductions in reimbursements by medicare poor results can also lead to penalties for hospitals and eventually doctors a recent survey of more than hip and knee surgeons confirmed dr yates s impressions percent said they used body mass index scores as cutoffs for requiring weight loss before offering surgery but there was no consistency in the figures they picked the numbers were all over the map dr yates said and percent who picked a body mass index cutoff said they had done so because they were worried about their performance score or that of their hospital it s very common to pick an arbitrary b m i number and say that is the number we won t go above dr yates said yet a person with an index of say might be healthy and active he said but in terrible pain from arthritis a knee replacement could be life transforming it s a game with everyone trying to have the patient dr yates said patients who may be at a marginally higher risk may be treated as a class instead of individuals that is the definition of discrimination surgery involves anesthesia of course giving rise to another issue there are no requirements for drug makers to figure out appropriate doses for obese patients only a few medical experts like dr hendrikus lemmens a professor of anesthesiology at stanford university have tried to provide answers his group looked at several drugs propofol which puts people to sleep before they get general anesthesia succinylcholine used to relax muscles in the windpipe when a breathing tube must be inserted and anesthetic gases propofol doses dr lemmens found should be based on lean body weight the weight of the body minus its fat using total body weight as is routine for people would result in an overdose for obese patients he said but succinylcholine doses should be based on total body weight he determined and the dosing of anesthetic gases is not significantly affected by obesity as for regional anesthetics he said there are very few data but they probably should be dosed according to lean body weight bad outcomes because of inappropriate dosing do occur said dr lemmens who added that to percent of all obese patients in intensive care after surgery were there because of anesthetic complications given the uncertainties about anesthetic doses for the obese dr lemmens said he suspects that a significant number of them had inappropriate dosing yet for many fat people the questions about appropriate medical care are beside the point because they stay away from doctors i have avoided going to a doctor at all said sarai walker the author of dietland a novel that is very common with fat people no matter what the problem is the doctor will blame it on fat and will tell you to lose weight do you think i don t know i am fat she added \n",
